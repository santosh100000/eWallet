# eWallet
In the eWallet project, I used Java Spring Boot to effectively demonstrate my learning of Kafka and Redis. Kafka was integrated for message queuing, enabling efficient data exchange between microservices through asynchronous message handling. Redis was employed for caching frequently accessed data, which significantly enhanced the application's performance by reducing database load and improving response times. This integration showcased how Kafka and Redis can be leveraged to build scalable and high-performance applications.
